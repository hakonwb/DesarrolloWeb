    €1 homes.

Chances are, you’ve heard about these. Whether on news reports, social media posst, or online articles, €1 homes are a quick attention grabber.

And if, for whatever reason, you didn’t stumble over these homes, I’ll give you a brief overview. The trend started in Italy, where cities, often with an older, dwindling population, began offering vacant homes for just €1.

Cities and governments offering these deals required some kind of financial investment in return for the nearly free home. In Italy, for example, after purchasing the property you would need to obtain the necessary permissions and contracts, begin renovations within two months, and pay some kind of “guarantee.” The guarantee would be money you’d receive back after the renovation, so you might end up paying a few thousand euro upfront in exchange for a front door key and the deed.

The lure of additional residents and outsider money spurred other countries like Croatia, Greece, and Spain to offer similar opportunities. Even some communities around Japan are selling abandoned properties for dirt cheap. These neighborhoods believe it is better to essentially give the house away if it means…

<h3 id="Variables en javascript">
    Variables en javascript
</h3>
<p>
    -String:
    Representa datos textuales o cadenas de caracteres. Se puede definir usando comillas simples, dobles, o backticks para templates literals, que permiten la interpolación de expresiones.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Number:
    Representa tanto números enteros como flotantes. En JavaScript, no hay distinción en el tipo de datos para enteros y decimales.
    <br>
    <br>
    -BigInt: 
    Este tipo puede representar números enteros mayores que 2^53-1 que es el límite para el tipo number.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Boolean:
    Tiene dos valores posibles: true (verdadero) y false (falso). Es útil para realizar operaciones lógicas.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Undefined:
    Este tipo se utiliza para variables que no han sido asignadas a un valor. Es un tipo de datos propio, diferente de no declarar una variable.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Null:
    Es un valor asignado que representa "ningún valor" o "valor nulo". A diferencia de undefined, null es asignado explícitamente a una variable como representación de no valor.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Object:
    Es una colección de propiedades, y una propiedad es una asociación entre un nombre (o clave) y un valor. El valor de una propiedad puede ser una función, en cuyo caso la propiedad es conocida como un método.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Symbol:
    Un valor único e inmutable que puede ser utilizado como la clave de una propiedad de objeto. Cada vez que se crea un valor Symbol, es único.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Function:
    Aunque en JavaScript, las funciones son objetos, se tratan a menudo como un tipo propio debido a su capacidad para ser llamadas.
</p>
<h3 id="ciclos en javascript">
    Ciclos en javascript
</h3>
<p>
    -for: Se utiliza para repetir un bloque de instrucciones un número determinado de veces. Requiere especificar una variable inicial, una condición para continuar el ciclo, y una expresión para actualizar la variable en cada iteración.
    <br>
    <br>
    -for...in: Itera sobre todas las propiedades enumerables de un objeto, proporcionando acceso a cada clave del objeto en cada iteración. Es útil para recorrer las propiedades de un objeto.
    <br>
    <br>
    -for...of: Proporciona una manera de iterar sobre los valores de los elementos iterables (como arrays, strings, o Map/Set). A diferencia del ciclo for...in, que itera sobre claves, for...of itera sobre los valores directamente.
    <br>
    <br>
    -while: Ejecuta un bloque de código mientras una condición especificada se evalúa como verdadera. La condición se evalúa antes de cada iteración, lo que significa que si la condición inicial es falsa, el bloque de código no se ejecutará ni una sola vez.
    <br>
    <br>
    -do...while: Similar al ciclo while, pero con la diferencia crucial de que la condición se evalúa después de ejecutar el bloque de instrucciones. Esto asegura que el bloque de código se ejecute al menos una vez, incluso si la condición inicial es falsa.
